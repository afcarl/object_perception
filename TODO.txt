[x] Use the prior boxes to create default boxes.
[x] Use the assign class to see which boxes match the ground truth with an intersection over union.
[x] With a ratio of [1, 3] use the negative boxes to sample background classification.
[ ] Train a classifier using all this images along with the image generator.
    - Try using HOG features.
[ ] Use your classifier as fully-convolution-neural-network using Gaussian pyramids.
